            <p class="summary">Here are some of the noteworthy projects Lyndir has been involved in. Most of the work is Open Source.</p>

            <h2><a href="http://gorillas.lyndir.com"> <img src="images/media/Gorillas.png" /> Gorillas</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">Gorillas is the clone of an arcade classic to the iPhone / iPod touch.</p>

            <p>Two gorillas stand on roof tops and take turns at throwing explosive bananas at each other. With the right angle and speed,
                taking into account the current wind velocity, your banana should obliterate the opponent on impact.</p>

            <p>The iPhone / iPod touch features a touch screen which lends itself perfectly for making these throws a real piece of cake.
                Just a single tap indicates the vector of your banana's initial velocity.</p>

            <p>Of course, the game features some tasty eye-candy, fully rendered in OpenGL. You can pick from several cities to fight in,
                each with a unique feel through a change in gravity and wind strength.</p>

            <p>You can also pick from several different game types, such as a classic game of Gorillas, a more dynamic game with
                auto-adjusting difficulty, a teamed game, or a last-man-standing free-for-all. </p>

            <h2><a href="http://deblock.lyndir.com"> <img src="images/media/DeBlock.png" /> DeBlock</a></h2>

            <p class="summary">DeBlock is an arcade block destruction game for the iPhone / iPod touch.</p>

            <p>A field is filled with blocks of random colors. Blocks that neighbour other blocks of the same color can be destroyed by
                tapping them. Surrounding blocks collapse and fold back into a new pile. The objective is to destroy all the linked blocks
                in the field in such an order that you end up with no more than 8 unlinked blocks. Clearing the field completely grants you
                a flawless bonus.</p>

            <p>Some blocks are special in a certain way. They are marked with a certain symbol and perform a special action when triggered.
                Some special blocks blow up all the blocks around them, others zap all blocks of their color, etc. Using them strategically
                is key at getting the better score and succeeding at later levels.</p>
